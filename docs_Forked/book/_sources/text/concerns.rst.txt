==============================================
    
Background
----------

* Right to Privacy (Brandeis, 1890)
* New privacy threats
    * Computerized records
    * Cookies and aggregation
    * Network monitoring (ISPs, etc.)
    * Inference  
* Personally Identifiable Information
    * Any information that distinguishes one person from another can be used for re-identifying data.  
    * Examples: Netflix recommender system de-anonymization  

Network Data and Inference
--------------------------
* Data
    * Data collection and retention
    * Data sharing, model sharing
* Adding compute to data brings a new dimension of threats to privacy
    * Old principles view data as storage for later retrieval.
    * No processing of data, other than simple joins
    * Now, we have computing/complex inference  
* Realms
    * Network traffic capture (packet traces)
    * Fingerprinting: Canvas/Browser, Website, Application  
    * Cookies and other web tracking mechanisms (tracking pixels) 
    * DNS privacy and encrypted DNS  
    * Supercookies (Verizon)  
    * IP addresses and geolocation
    * WiFi and Bluetooth triangulation

----------------

Focus on examples and cases that have had to do specifically with machine
learning (and networking).
