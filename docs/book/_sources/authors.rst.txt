About The Authors
==================

**Noah Apthorpe** is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Colgate University.
Previously, he was a graduate fellow in the Princeton University Center for Information Technology Policy (CITP).

His research combines networks, machine learning, and human-computer interaction to study 
privacy & security implications of connected technologies, including Internet of things (IoT) devices.
He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Princeton University in 2020. 
His dissertation, "Network Privacy and User Protection in the Internet of Things,"
identified novel IoT privacy vulnerabilities, enabled the collection and study of IoT network data at scale, 
and informed recommendations for device manufacturers, regulators, and consumer advocates. 
He received his M.A. and B.S.E. degrees in computer science from Princeton University in 2017 and 2014, respectively.

Noah lives in Hamilton, New York.


**Nick Feamster** is Neubauer Professor of Computer Science and the Director of
Center for Data and Computing (CDAC) at the University of Chicago. Previously,
he was a full professor in the Computer Science Department at Princeton
University, where he directed the Center for Information Technology Policy
(CITP); prior to Princeton, he was a full professor in the School of Computer
Science at Georgia Tech.

His research focuses on many aspects of computer networking and networked
systems, with a focus on network operations, network security, and
censorship-resistant communication systems. He received his Ph.D. in Computer
science from MIT in 2005, and his S.B. and M.Eng. degrees in Electrical
Engineering and Computer Science from MIT in 2000 and 2001, respectively. He
was an early-stage employee at Looksmart (acquired by AltaVista), where he
wrote the company's first web crawler; and at Damballa, where he helped design
the company's first botnet-detection algorithm.

Nick is an avid distance runner, having completed more than 20 marathons,
including Boston, New York, and Chicago, as well as the Comrades Marathon, an
iconic ultra-marathon in South Africa. He lives in Chicago, Illinois.
