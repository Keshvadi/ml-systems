Chapter 3: Data Acquisition
===========================

Managing networks requires gathering information that can be used to drive
decisions about how to adapt to changing conditions. Doing so requires
gathering information that can be used as input to the decision-making
process, which includes models that perform prediction and inference about the
state of the network and the applications running on it. This process, often
referred to as *data acquisition* in machine learning, has a longstanding
tradition in networking, and is often referred to as simply *network
measurement*. There are many ways to gather information about the network,
which we will discuss in this chapter. Ultimately, however, gathering data
with the intent of providing input to machine learning models can be a more
involved process, since the data must be collected in a way that both results
in effective training for the models, and in an efficient manner.

There are many reasons to measure networks and many ways of gathering these
measurements. As we discussed in the previous chapter, for example, networks
can be measured to for performance diagnosis and troubleshooting, security,
forecasting, and many other use cases. Before we can talk about models, we
first need to discuss the different ways that network data can be collected.
Internet measurement itself is rapidly evolving, as new tools and capabilities
emerge. In this chapter, we will explore both conventional techniques for
Internet measurement, as well as emerging techniques to measure and gather
data from networks. We will also explore how emerging technologies are both
expanding the types of measurements that can be gathered from networks and
making it possible to gather new types of measurements. We will also talk
about the process of transforming the raw data into a form that can be used
for training machine learning models---in other words, going from raw
measurement data to aggregate statistics and ultimately to features.

We will explore network measurement in the context of two different types of
measurement: (1) active measurement, which introduces new traffic into the
network to measure various network properties (from performance to topology);
and (2) passive measurement, which captures existing traffic on the network to
infer information about traffic that is already being sent across the network
by existing applications and services.  Each of these types of measurements
have various classes of tools to measure certain properties, as well as
various considerations. A simple way to think about these two classes of
measurement is that active measurements can directly measure certain
properties of a specific network path (e.g., its capacity, latency,
application properties in some cases, or even the path itself) but cannot
provide direct insight into the circumstances that a particular user or
application may be experiencing.

We'll then explore these two types of measurement in more detail, explaining
how each technique works, and what it can (and cannot) measure.  Along the
way, we'll dive into the details with a few examples and hands-on activities,
introducing both techniques for processing raw network data into more
aggregate statistics, as well as software libraries that can perform some of
these transformations.  Before getting into specific measurement techniques,
let's talk a little bit about what metrics can be measured in the first place.

What to Measure
---------------

There are a wide variety of metrics that can be measured from network data.
We highlight some of the common metrics below. Typically, these metrics
can be measured directly, either by injecting traffic into the network and
observing behavior (*active measurement*) or by collecting existing network
traffic and computing statistics about what is being observed (*passive
measurement*). 

Of course, in machine learning, the goal is *inference*, which means that
the metrics that can be measured directly, which we discuss below, are often
used as inputs (or "features") to a machine learning model to predict or infer
higher-level phenomena or events, from application quality of experience to
attacks. Below, we highlight some of these metrics, and discuss which of these
metrics can be measured with active measurement, passive measurement, or both.

    * **Throughput** concerns the amount of time it takes to transfer a
      certain quantity of data. It is typically measured in bits per second
      (or some multiple of bits per second, such as gigabits per second).
      Measuring throughput is important because it indicates how much data a
      network is capable of moving between two network endpoints within a
      fixed time window. When networks delivered relatively low throughput, it
      was the predominant determining factor for a user's experience. As a
      result, it is the dimension of performance that is most commonly
      referred to and benchmarked against when considering things like the
      performance of consumer broadband Internet access. For example, you
      might buy a "1 Gigabit" service plan from your ISP, which typically
      indicates that you can expect a downstream (i.e., from a server
      somewhere on the Internet to your home) throughput of approximately 1
      gigabit per second (1 Gbps).

    * **Latency** concerns the amount of time it takes a unit of data (e.g., a
      packet) to reach an Internet destination. Latency is measured in
      seconds. A fundamental contributor to latency is the speed of light, but
      because Internet traffic is multiplexed in queues, when traffic
      congestion occurs, packets in buffers can also introduce additional
      latency. Latency is becoming increasingly important, and can be a
      differentiator in performance between networks, particularly for
      networks that have network equipment with large buffers that can
      introduce delays when those parts of the network become bottlenecks. The
      metric is also becoming increasingly important and relevant in the
      context of interactive applications, such as video conferencing, gaming,
      and even the web. A related important metric is latency under load,
      which is the latency experienced by packets when the network is carrying
      other traffic that saturates the capacity of the link, even if briefly
      (e.g., starting a streaming video, uploading a photo, sending an email,
      browsing the web).

    * **Jitter** reflects the change in latency over time---it is effectively
      the first derivative of latency, or the change in packet inter-arrival
      time. As with latency, it is measured in seconds (or, more commonly,
      milliseconds). Many applications, especially interactive ones like
      voice, video, and gaming, expect network traffic to arrive at regular,
      fixed intervals. When traffic does not arrive at such fixed intervals
      either user experience is degraded, or the application must introduce a
      larger buffer to smooth out variation in packet inter-arrival.

    * **Packet loss** concerns the fraction of packets that fail to reach
      their intended destination. Packet loss can be detrimental to
      performance because certain transport protocols like the Transmission
      Control Protocol (TCP) interpret loss as congestion and slow down as a
      result of observing packet loss. Packet loss is of course also
      inherently detrimental to user experience, as lost packets represent
      lost data---which could correspond to frames in a video, words in a
      voice call, and so forth. 

How to Measure
--------------

There are two primary ways to measure networks: active measurement and passive
measurement. Active measurement involves injecting traffic into the network
and observing the behavior of the network. Passive measurement involves
capturing existing traffic on the network and observing the behavior of the
network. In this section, we will discuss the two types of measurement in
more detail, and explore the different ways that each type of measurement can
be used to gather data.

Active Measurement
++++++++++++++++++

One way to measure the characteristics of a network is to send traffic across
the network towards a particular endpoint and observe the characteristics of
those measurements in terms of the metrics that we discussed in the previous
section. Specifically, one can measure throughput, latency, jitter, packet
loss, and other properties of a specific Internet path by sending traffic
across the network and observing these metrics of the traffic along that path. 

Active measurement is a broad topic: 
It refers to any type of measurement that involves sending traffic
into the network---sometimes referred to as "probes"---and observing how
different network endpoints respond to these probes. As far as gathering
network traffic data is concerned, active measurements involve various
tradeoffs. On one hand, conducting active measurements does not typically
involve privacy considerations, since it does not involve capturing user
traffic that may include sensitive information (e.g., the websites that a user
is visiting). Additionally, because active measurements can be run from any
network endpoint, they are typically easier to gather than passive
measurements (which can often require the installation of specific passive
network traffic capture infrastructure).

There are many different types of active measurements one could perform, and
as a result, there are simply too many types to cover in this chapter. We
will, however, have a brief look at three types of active Internet
measurements because they are so common: (1) Internet "speed tests" (2) domain
name system (DNS) queries and responses; (3) probing and scanning. These three
classes of active measurements are not exhaustive, but they do capture many
cases of active measurement research and practice. We give a brief overview of
each in this chapter and offer pointers to more detailed treatment of this
material elsewhere.

**Types of Active Measurement**


*Internet speed tests.* Perhaps one of the most canonical application
performance measurements is the Internet "speed test", which typically refers
as a test of application throughput.  Users commonly measure throughput with a
client-based "speed test"; a common speed test, for example, is speedtest.net,
operated by Ookla. While the detailed designs of these tests may vary, the
general principle of these tests is conceptually simple: they typically try to
send (or receive) as much data as possible to (or from) some Internet
destination as possible and measure the time taken to transfer a particular
amount of data over some window. The tests themselves often involve sending a
fixed amount of data and measuring the transfer time for that data.  Measuring
the time it takes for a client to send data to some Internet server
corresponds to "upload speed"; measuring the time for a client to receive data
from destination corresponds to the "download speed".  Naturally, one critical
design choice for an active measurement like a speed test is where to measure
to or from; this design consideration is outside the scope of this book, but
it is important to note because the quality of the measurements can thus
depend on the choice of endpoint to measure.

A common example of an Internet speed test is speedtest.net, but many other
organizations operate speed tests, including Measurement Lab's Network
Diagnostic Test (NDT), Fast.com (operated by Netflix), the Federal
Communications Commission's Measuring Broadband America program (which
operates a router-based speed test from SamKnows), and so on. The design of
Internet speed tests has been varied and contentious over the years; it is the
topic of many research papers and outside the scope of this book. We refer the
interested reader to related research. Important for the purposes of analysis
and machine learning, however, is that these tests often produce two numbers,
corresponding to throughput in each direction along a network path, typically
measured in megabits per second (or gigabits per second). With the increasing
acknowledgement that other metrics are important for understanding network
performance (as discussed above), Internet "speed tests" are evolving to
include and report on those metrics as well.

A common way to measure latency is using the ping tool, which sends a
continuous stream of small packets towards a particular Internet destination,
waits for the response, and measures how much time that request-response round
trip required. Although ping is a very common tool, it uses a protocol called
the Internet control message protocol (ICMP), which can sometimes be blocked by
security firewalls and is also sometimes treated completely differently by
on-path Internet routers (e.g., prioritized or de-prioritized). Thus, although
active measurements are always susceptible to being non-representative of user
traffic and experience, ICMP traffic runs this risk even more. As such, an
alternative (and common) latency measurement involves sending TCP SYN packets
and waiting for the SYN-ACK reply. These *transport-level probes* allow for
sending traffic on ports that are often not filtered by firewalls and more
likely to be processed by routers as normal traffic would be. Another commonly
used active measurement tool is traceroute, which sends TTL-limited probes to
attempt to measure an end-to-end Internet path. As with ping, the nature of
how traceroute is implemented introduces various aspects of uncertainty: the
probes or the replies may be blocked by middleboxes, and the forward and
reverse paths may not be symmetric, leading to various measurement
inaccuracies. We refer the reader to related research to understand the
limitations of traceroute.

*Domain Name System (DNS) queries and responses.* The performance of many
Internet applications ultimately depends on the performance of the Domain Name
System (DNS), the system that maps Internet domain names to IP addresses,
among other tasks. Various tools have been developed to measure the
performance and characteristics of the DNS, including how DNS relates to
application performance (e.g., web page load time), and tests that can detect
whether DNS responses have been manipulated (e.g., by an Internet censor or
other adversary). With the rise of encrypted DNS protocols (e.g., DNS over
HTTPS), there has been increasing attention into the performance of these
protocols. As such, new tools have been developed and released to measure both
the performance characteristics and behavior of various DNS resolvers.

*Internet scans.* One of the more established (and general) ways of
performing active Internet measurements is to perform a so-called Internet
"scan", which typically involves sending a small amount of traffic (sometimes
a single, specially crafted packet) to a single network endpoint and measuring
the response. Internet scans could include simple measurements like ping (to
measure uptime, or as a simple latency measurement) though commonly they can
involve crafting more sophisticated probes that are designed to elicit a
particular response. A common type of probe is to send a TCP SYN packet (i.e.,
the first packet in a TCP connection) to a list of "target" IP addresses and
observe how these endpoints respond, in order to perform some kind of
conclusion or inference. Such techniques and variants have been performed to
conduct Internet-wide characterizations of Internet endpoints (e.g., uptime of
network endpoints, operating systems of endpoints). Sophisticated target scans
can also be used as active DNS measurements: the Internet contains so-called
"open DNS resolvers" that respond to remote active probes, and sending such
probes and measuring how resolvers respond can also be useful in
characterizing certain aspects of DNS across the Internet. While the most
common tools for scanning the Internet are "ping" and "traceroute", a wide
array of scanning tools has been developed, including nmap and more recently
zmap.

**Applications of Active Measurement**

Active measurements can yield information about network endpoints, or about
paths between endpoints.  As previously mentioned, one common approach to
gathering data through active network measurements is through what is called a
*scan*, whereby a single (or small number) of machines on the network send
traffic to other network endpoints in an attempt to elicit a response from
those endpoints. That response is typically a response that corresponds to the
protocol traffic that was sent to the device (e.g., a reply to an ICMP ping, a
response to a TCP SYN packet, a response to an HTTP(S) request, a response to a
TLS handshake request). Based on those response packets, the measurement device
that initiated the active measurement can collect responses. The existence (or
lack thereof), format, structure, or content of those responses can then
subsequently be used as features in supervised or unsupervised machine learning
algorithms for a variety of tasks.

A common application of machine learning to network data gathered from
active measurements is *fingerprinting*. Just about anything in the
network can be fingerprinted, or identified---things that can be
fingerprinted include network infrastructure (e.g., routers, middleboxes),
device types (e.g., laptop, desktop, mobile), operating system, TLS version,
and so forth. One classical network fingerprinting tool is called nmap; the tool
would scan another network endpoint and, based on the format of reply packets,
could then determine with reasonable accuracy the operating system (and
OS version) of the endpoint. The conventional version of nmap used a static
set of rules to determine the likely operating system using features that were
discovered and encoded by hand (e.g., TCP options, congestion control
parameters). More recently, research has demonstrated that, given operating
system labels and TCP SYN-ACK packets (i.e., responses to the initial part of
the TCP three-way handshake), it is possible to train machine
learning models that can automatically discover the operating system of a
network endpoint, to a much greater degree of accuracy than nmap.

Network measurement has other forms of active measurement that could
ultimately be amenable to machine learning, although these areas are somewhat
less explored. One particular possible application area is *anomaly
detection*, specifically unsupervised learning techniques to detect unusual,
actionable changes in network performance. For example, network operators
commonly perform active measurements to measure network characteristics like
availability (i.e., uptime), round-trip latency, and so forth. Due to the
packet-switched nature of traffic delivery on the Internet, some amount of
latency variation and packet loss is normal, and to be expected. On the other
hand, more unusual or severe latency aberrations might warrant operator
attention. To date, it is less well-understood how to automatically examine
longitudinal latency performance measurements and (1) reliably determine when
an aberration requires operator attention vs. being part of normal network
operations or conditions (e.g., buffering); (2) determine the underlying cause
of the latency problem (and, in particular, whether the source of that latency
aberration is due to a problem within the ISP network, the user's home
network, an endpoint device, or some other cause).

Passive Measurement
+++++++++++++++++++

In contrast to active measurement, which introduces new traffic into the
network to measure the performance of the network, *passive measurement*
monitors existing traffic in the network and infers properties about the
network from the measured traffic. Passive measurement has the characteristic
(and, in many ways, the advantage) that the resulting data corresponds to
actual traffic that is traversing the network (e.g., a user's actual web
browsing or streaming video session) and thus the traffic that is captured may
more accurately reflect the properties, behavior, and performance of
application performance or user experience. 

**Types of Passive Measurement**


*Packet-level monitoring.* The most universal form of passive measurement is
*packet capture*, sometimes also called *pcap* for short. Packet capture is
essentially the equivalent of "listening in" on a network conversation, akin
to a wiretap of sorts. A packet capture will (as the name suggests), capture
all bytes that traverse the network. Common programs that perform packet
capture are tcpdump and wireshark.  These programs will not only capture the
raw bytes as they traverse the network, but they also will parse the bytes
into a format that humans (or programs) can read. For example, these programs
are equipped with libraries that can parse protocols like Ethernet, TCP, IP,
and a variety of application protocols, making it possible to read and
understand traffic as it traverses the network.

Packet capture does introduce a few tradeoffs. One disadvantage of pcaps is
that they can be quite voluminous, particularly on high-speed links.  The
volume of packet captures can make it difficult not only to capture all of the
packets as they traverse the network, but also to store, transfer, and later
process the data.  For this reason, packet captures are sometimes
truncated---capturing only the packet headers, as opposed to the complete
"payload". 

.. sidebar:: Activity: Data Acquisition from Passive Measurement

    The :ref:`Appendix <appendix-data-acquisition>` provides an activity that
    allows you to explore the information that can be derived from passive
    measurement of network traffic, specifically packets captured from the
    network.  You will load the data into a Pandas dataframe, and then explore
    the data to answer a number of high-level questions about the data. 


*Flow-level monitoring.* Other aggregated representations of packet captures
are often used to reduce volume, storage, or processing overhead. One common
example of aggregation is IPFIX (sometimes more commonly known by Netflow,
which is the Cisco-proprietary version of the format). IPFIX reports only
aggregate statistics for each flow in the network, where a flow is defined by
a unique five-tuple---source and destination IP address, source and
destination port, and protocol---as well as a time window of activity (e.g.,
continuous transfer without an interruption for more than a certain time
interval, as well as a maximum time length). For each flow, an IPFIX record
contains salient features, such as the start and end time of the flow, the
five-tuple of the flow, the number of packets and bytes in the flow, any TCP
flags that may have been observed over the duration of the flow, and the
router interface on which the traffic was observed.   IPFIX has the advantage
of being more compact than packet captures, but the format does not represent
certain aspects of network traffic that can sometimes be useful for
statistical inference and machine learning. For example, IPFIX does not
represent individual packet interarrival times, the sizes of individual
packets, short-timescale traffic bursts, and so forth.

For many years, packet captures were prohibitively expensive, and operators
had to largely make due with sampled packet traces, and even IPFIX records
that were based on probabilistic samples of traffic that traversed a router
interface (sometimes referred to as "sampled IPFIX" or "sampled NetFlow"). On
high-speed links in transit networks, these representations are still common.
Yet, increasingly, and especially at the network edge, packet capture at very
high rates is now possible. Technologies such as eBPF, PF_RING, and other
libraries now make it possible to capture packet traces at speeds of more than
40 Gbps, for example. These new technologies are causing us to reconsider how
network traffic might be captured---and represented---for machine learning
models. For decades, machine learning models for networking tasks, from
performance to security, had to rely in large part on IPFIX-based
representations as input. Now, these new capture and monitoring technologies
are making it possible to capture raw data at very high rates---and causing us
to rethink what the "best" representations might be for a wide array of
networking tasks that might rely on machine learning.


*Programmatic Interfaces.*
Ultimately, analyzing packet captures programmatically can require more
sophisticated libraries and APIs. While many of these programmatic options are
typically restricted to running on general-purpose computing devices (e.g.,
servers, middleboxes), as opposed to network-specific hardware, software-based
options provide significant flexibility in manipulating and analyzing packet
capture---including generating features that can be used for machine learning
models.

A good place to become familiar with low-level software packet capture
libraries, particularly if you are new to the area, is Python's `scapy` library;
scapy will get you going quickly, but its performance may leave something to
be desired if you wish to conduct real-time measurements, parsing, and
analysis.  Other options have a steeper learning curve; these include eBPF,
dpkt, and PF_RING.  We have built on these libraries in a tool and
accompanying Python library, `netml`, which we will use to conduct many of
the exercises in this book.

**Applications of Passive Measurement**

There is also an increased desire to measure what is known as **quality of
experience**, or **QoE**.  QoE has several connotations---it can be used to refer to
either application quality metrics, for example, video resolution, startup
delay, or rebuffering in the case of streaming video.  More generally, it can
also refer to a user's general satisfaction level or, rather, quality of
experience, when interacting with a particular application; a common metric for
this type of QoE is a mean opinion score (MOS). Sometimes, people use the term
"application QoE" to differentiate application quality metrics from general
user experience.

Tradeoffs: Active vs. Passive Measurement
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Active measurements may be convenient to
implement but have their own drawbacks: (1) they require measuring to a
particular network endpoint, which in certain cases (e.g., a speed test, an
active measurement of network performance) requires setting up a server on the
other end of the measurement; (2) they involve introducing additional traffic
into the network, which in some cases may introduce prohibitive network load;
(3) because the measurements themselves are synthetic, the measurements
themselves may not be representative of what a user actually experiences.

As previously discussed, there is also an increasing desire to measure the
quality of specific applications, in particular applications such as web
browsing, video streaming, real-time video conferencing, and so forth. One way
of assessing the quality of these applications is using active measurements
that emulate the behavior of these specific applications. For example, the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) incorporates active measurements for
web performance and video streaming performance for specific services into
their Measuring Broadband America (MBA) test suite. 

There are several challenges with using application-specific measurements to
assess application performance. First, application probes must be designed for
each specific application, and the probes themselves must mimic the behavior
of that application. Accordingly, different applications must have custom
probes to accurately measure the performance of the respective application.
Furthermore, accurate performance measurement of each application also
requires the appropriate measurement infrastructure, such as servers, located
in the appropriate locations (e.g., content delivery networks).  As a result
of these complications, a preferred method for measuring application
performance is to *passively* measure the traffic of the respective
applications and *infer* the application quality. This endeavor turns out to
be both a measurement problem and a machine learning problem! We will discuss
passive measurement in the next section and applications of machine learning
to passively collected network traffic in subsequent sections.


From Acquisition to Model Input
-------------------------------

Now that we understand the different forms that network data (and, in
particular, network traffic measurements) can take, we turn to understanding
some of the tools that enable the capture of network traffic data, as well as
the complementary libraries how we can use the data captured using those tools
to perform analysis and prediction.  

We defer specific discussion of machine learning pipelines to the next
chapter, since the application of machine learning models to data presents its
own set of challenges. Rather, we will focus on common ways to analyze network
traffic using familiar software tools. In this book, we will focus on the use
of Python to perform this type of data analysis. Although similar analysis is
possible in other frameworks and languages, some of the more cutting-edge
tools that we will explore in this book are primarily available through Python
APIs, so Python is a good place to start.

From Packets to Flows
+++++++++++++++++++++

A common tool to analyze passive traffic measurements is *Wireshark*. Wireshark
is an application that can be installed on many common operating systems,
including Mac, Windows, and Linux.  Underlying the Wireshark tool itself is a
library called libpcap, which provides an interface between the network
interface card and the software applications that read data from packets into
memory and process them.

:numref:`Figure %s <fig-wireshark>` shows an example analysis from Wireshark. Each
row in the application represents a single packet, and each column represents
a particular field. Clicking on any particular row will yield additional
information in the bottom half of the split screen. The information is
arranged according to the packet's "layers", with the Ethernet information at
the top, followed by the IP information, the TCP information, and finally any
information that might be contained in the payload. Because much modern
Internet traffic is encrypted, most of the information that we will use (and
apply) with machine learning examples in this book will come from the header
information.

Taking a closer look at the fields in each packet, particular information
turns out to frequently be useful for a wide variety of machine learning
tasks. Relevant features include, for example, the length of each packet and
the time that packet was observed. Even before diving into further detail,
observe that these two pieces of information alone allow for a wide range of
processing options for generating features. For example, packet lengths can be
represented individually, as sequences, as summary statistics, as
distributions, and so forth. Combined with timing information, it is possible
to compute various traffic rates (e.g., packets per second, bytes per second
over various time intervals). 

Combining these basic statistics with additional information from the packet
header makes it possible to generate these features for individual flows:
Specifically, individual traffic flows are typically defined by five values
across the packet header, sometimes called a 5-tuple: Source and destination
IP address, source and destination port, and protocol. Deriving the
aforementioned statistics according to packets that belong to the same "flow"
(i.e., share a common 5-tuple) also makes it possible to generate (and analyze
statistics) across flows, or even groups of related flows. The types of tools
that generate this type of flow statistics generally operate on network
devices, such as routers and switches. For example, on Cisco routers, the
software that is used to produce flow records is commonly referred to as
NetFlow. A standard version of this software and format is called IPFIX.


From Flows to Features
++++++++++++++++++++++

Representations of network traffic that are most effective for prediction and
inference problems in networking detection are typically {\em a priori}
unclear.  Representation choices typically involve various statistics
concerning traffic volumes, packet sampling rates, and aggregation intervals.
Yet, which of these transformations retain predictive information is typically
initially unknown.  One example challenge is choosing the granularity on
which to aggregate a feature: For instance, if we decide to measure and
represent the number of packets per second as a feature, then changes in
traffic patterns at the millisecond level might go undetected; on the other
hand, recording at this granularity creates higher dimensional observations
introducing high-dimensional data that creates challenges with both scale and
accuracy.  (The so-called *curse of dimensionality* in machine learning is
the observed fact that the higher the dimension of the input, the harder it is
to achieve good accuracy; in particular, we might then require an amount of
training data exponential as a function of dimension.)


The process of feature extraction from raw network traffic affects the accuracy
of a variety of models.  There are many possible ways to represent raw traffic
traces (i.e., packets) as inputs. The data itself can be aggregated on various
time windows, elided, transformed into different bases, sampled, and so forth.
We focus on representations of network traffic data that do not incorporate
semantics from the header itself, such as IP addresses, port numbers, sequence
numbers, or other specific values in the packet headers themselves.
Representations that are agnostic to specific values in the headers ensures
that the resulting models are trained to recognize novel behavior regardless of
the {\em specific} source, destination, application, or location in the
network. In contrast to past work in this area, which has typically focused on
a single problem in novelty detection using a single dataset and a chosen
procedure, our focus is on studying the applicability of representation, we aim
for {\em generality} and reproducibility of results across a range of problems,
studying the applicability of different representations across a range of
problems.

`netml` is a network anomaly detection tool and library written in Python. It
consists of two sub-modules: (1) a `pcap` parser that produces flows using
Scapy/dpkt and (2) a novelty detection module that applies the novelty
detection algorithms. The library takes network packet traces as input,
transforms them into various data representations, and can be incorporated as a
Python library or invoked directly from the command line. 

.. sidebar:: Activity: Feature Extraction

    The :ref:`Appendix <appendix-feature-extraction>` provides an initial
    opportunity to use the `netml` library to extract features from a network
    trace.  The `netml` library is publicly available on Github as an open-source Python
    library. It has been packaged on PyPi for easy installation. 


The `netml` library consists of approximately 11,000 lines of Python, with the
packet parsing module comprising approximately 3,500 lines of Python, the
implementations of various novelty detection modules comprising another 3,000
lines, another 3,000 lines in support of the `netml` command-line utility, and
the rest of the code in support of various utilities (e.g., testing).  `netml`
is a useful tool for converting network traffic captures to features that can
be used for various network analysis tasks. It has been designed, implemented,
and released as an open-source tool to help researchers and practitioners in
the field of network security.
