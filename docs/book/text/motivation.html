<h1>Chapter 2: Motivating Problems<a class="headerlink" href="#chapter-2-motivating-problems" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Various tasks in computer networking rely on drawing inferences from data
gathered from networks. Generally speaking, these networking tasks fall one of
the following categories:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Attack detection</strong>, which seeks to develop methods to detect and
identify a wide class of attacks. Common examples of attack detection
include spam filtering, botnet detection, denial of service attack
detection, and malicious website detection.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Anomaly detection</strong> (also known as <strong>novelty detection</strong>), which seeks
to identify unusual traffic, network events, or activity based on
deviations from “normal” observations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Performance diagnosis</strong>, which seeks to infer the performance
properties of a network device, appliance, or application. Performance
diagnosis can be short-term (e.g., detection of a sudden degradation in
application quality) or long-term (e.g., determination of the need to
provision additional capacity in the network).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Performance prediction</strong>, which seeks to determine or predict the
effects of the network (or its applications) in response to a particular
change in infrastructure and environment. Such “what if” predictions
could be concerned with predicting the possible outcomes from a failure
(e.g., what happens to traffic load or application performance if a
particular component fails) or from changes to configuration (e.g., what
happens to application response time or overall reliability if more
capacity is added at a particular data center).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Device and application identification</strong>, which seeks to identify or
classify network applications or devices based on observed measurements.
Common <em>fingerprinting</em> applications include application identification
(i.e., identifying applications from observed traffic that is typically
encrypted), website fingerprinting (i.e., identifying the webpage or
website that a user is visiting from encrypted traffic) and device
identification.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>These application categories are not mutually exclusive and may overlap to
some degree. For example, some aspects of attack detection and anomaly
detection overlap.  A distinction between attack detection and anomaly
detection is that attack detection tends to involve supervised learning
techniques (and labeled data), whereas anomaly detection often draws on
unsupervised techniques. Anomaly detection applications can also be
broader than attack detection—for example.  Anomaly detection could
entail detecting a misconfiguration or component failure. The rest of this
chapter explores each of these classes of application in more detail and also
introduces methods that are commonly used to address problems in each area.</p>
<div class="section" id="security">
<h2>Security<a class="headerlink" href="#security" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>One of the earliest applications of machine learning to networking was in the
area of network security; specifically, the problem of detecting email spam
based on the contents of the message was one of the earliest applications of
what is known as a Naive Bayes spam filter. Since that first application,
machine learning techniques have been applied to detect a variety of attacks,
including the detection of denial of service attacks, phishing, botnets, and
other attacks.  In many cases, machine learning has been applied to <em>detect</em> a
network-based attack <em>post hoc</em>, but in some cases machine learning has even
been used to <em>predict</em> attacks before they happen, as we discuss below.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title">Activity: Security</p>
<p>The <a class="reference internal" href="appendix.html#appendix-security"><span class="std std-ref">Appendix</span></a> provides an opportunity to explore a security
application in the context of network traffic analysis, exploring how
features of attack traffic differ from normal web browsing activities.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="botnets-spam-and-malware">
<h3>Botnets, Spam, and Malware<a class="headerlink" href="#botnets-spam-and-malware" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>One of the earliest forms of messaging on the Internet was electronic mail
(“email”). The design of the Internet made it possible for anyone to send a
message to anyone else on the Internet as long as that recipient’s email
address was known. Because the marginal cost of sending an email is so low, an
ecosystem of <em>spammers</em> developed; email spam dates back to the 1990s and at
one point constituted more than 90% of all email traffic on the Internet. To
combat the growing tide of email spam, system administrators developed spam
filters to “automatically” distinguish spam from legitimate email based on the
words that were included in the contents of the mail.  The intuition behind
these initial spam filters is relatively straightforward: spam email is more
likely to contain certain words that do not appear in legitimate email, and
vice versa.  Based on this simple observation, it was relatively
straightforward to train simple Naive Bayes classifiers based on existing
corpora of email that had already been labeled as spam or “ham”. Such a Naive
Bayes classifier could then take an existing email and classify it based on
the frequencies of different words in the email.</p>
<p>Over time, however, spammers wised up to content-based spam filtering and
began to create messages that confused and evaded these filters. Common
approaches included creating emails with “hidden” words (e.g., white text on
white background) that would increase the likelihood that a spam message would
be classified as legitimate. One of the more significant challenges with
content-based spam filters is that they are relatively easy to evade in this
fashion. Over time, the security industry worked to develop more robust
filters based on features that are more difficult to evade. One such
development was the use of network-level features in spam classifiers, such as
the Internet service provider or autonomous system (AS) from which a spam
message originated, the distance the message traveled, the density of mail
servers in the IP address space of the email sender and so forth. These
features ultimately proved to be more robust, particularly when used in
conjunction with content-based features.</p>
<p>Ultimately, similar classes of features became useful for detecting other
types of network attacks, including botnets. A pioneering use of machine
learning in network security, in particular, was the use of domain name system
(DNS) traffic to detect large networks of compromised hosts, or so-called
<em>botnets</em>. Various behaviors characteristic of botnets make them particularly
amenable to detection via machine learning-based classifiers. Notably, many
botnets rely on some form of “command and control” (C&amp;C) infrastructure from which
they receive commands about launching different forms of attack (e.g., denial
of service, spam, phishing).  Coordinating such activity from a C&amp;C—which is
often at least logically centralized—typically results in DNS lookups to the
C&amp;C server that do not follow the patterns of normal DNS lookup activity. Such
lookup characteristics can thus be used to distinguish “normal” Internet hosts
from those that may be members of a botnet.</p>
<p>Applying machine learning to DNS traffic to detect malware and botnets has
become a very active area of research and innovation over the past 15 years.
Recent developments in DNS protocols, however, notably the trend towards
encrypting DNS traffic, are poised to shift this landscape. Specifically,
because DNS traffic has been (1) unencrypted, and (2) visible by Internet
service providers (or anyone operating a recursive DNS resolver), and because
DNS traffic has been such a good predictor of common forms of Internet attack,
it has been appealing and relatively straightforward to develop
machine learning-based attack detection methods based on DNS traffic. Many
companies, for example, could sell security appliances to Internet service
providers, enterprise networks, or other institutions that would simply
“listen” to DNS traffic and detect unusual behavior. More recent
trends—notably the evolution of DNS to rely on encrypted transport and
application protocols (i.e., DNS-over-TLS, and its more popular variant
DNS-over-HTTPS), and the deployment of these technologies in increasingly more
(and popular) operating systems and browsers means that DNS traffic is
becoming more difficult for certain parties to observe, and in many cases
(e.g., in the case of Oblivious DNS), difficult to attribute a DNS lookup to
the IP address that performed the lookup.</p>
<p>Some methods have applied machine learning to take attack detection one step
further—<em>predicting</em> the attack before it even occurs. This approach
recognizes that many network attacks require the establishment of
infrastructure, including possibly registering one or more domain names,
setting up a website, and so forth. Other techniques have observed that
unusual network attachment points (e.g., the Internet service provider that
provides connectivity for a scam site) can also be indicative of attacks or
other unwanted network activity (e.g., cybercrime). For example, it is
well-understood that the Russian Business Network, a cybercriminal
organization that provides web hosting, routinely changes its upstream ISP to
maintain connectivity in the face of shutdown.  The ability to detect unusual
behavior that is evident in the establishment of infrastructure is potentially
useful because these activities occur <em>before</em> an attack takes place. Thus, a
machine learning algorithm that could detect unusual behavior in these
settings could potentially not only detect an attack, but also predict one.
The features that are used to predict such attacks could include those related
to DNS or other network infrastructure, including various lexical properties of the
domain name, when and where the domain was registered, the authoritative name
server for the domain, and so forth; they also may include those related to
the routing infrastructure such as the entity (or entities) providing upstream
connectivity to a group of IP addresses, and whether (and how) those
connectivity properties have evolved over time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="account-compromise">
<h3>Account Compromise<a class="headerlink" href="#account-compromise" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Another area where machine learning is commonly applied is the detection of
compromised accounts. In particular, attackers may attempt to compromise a
user account with stolen credentials (e.g., a password, authentication keys),
and system administrators may wish to detect that such unauthorized access has
occurred. To do so, system administrators may use a variety of features
including the geographic location of the user who is logging into the account
(and whether that has changed over time), the type of device being used to log
into the account, the number of failed login attempts, various
telemetry-related features (e.g., keystroke patterns) and so forth.</p>
<p>Past work in this area, for example, has used machine learning techniques to
detect anomalous behavior, such as a sudden change in login behavior or
locations. For example, Microsoft’s Azure security team uses machine learning
to adapt to adversaries as these adversaries attempt to gain unauthorized
access to accounts and systems. The scale of the problem is significant,
involving hundreds of terabytes of authentication logs, more than a billion
monthly active users, and more than 25 billion authentications per day.
Machine learning has proved effective in detecting account compromise in this
environment, adapting to adversaries with limited human intervention, as well
as capturing non-linear correlations between features and labels (in this
case, predicting whether an attack has taken place). These models must take
into account a variety of inputs, including authentication logs, threat data,
the login behavior on accounts, and so forth. Input features to these models
include aspects such as whether the login occurs at a normal or abnormal time
of day, whether the login is coming from a known device, application, IP
address, and country, whether the IP address the login is coming from has been
blacklisted, and so forth. An interesting characteristic of the application of
machine learning in this particular context is the importance of domain
knowledge, both as it pertains to assessing data quality, as well as in the
process of engineering and representing features to models.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="anomaly-detection">
<h3>Anomaly Detection<a class="headerlink" href="#anomaly-detection" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Anomaly detection—sometimes also referred to as <em>novelty detection</em>—
describes a broad class of problems that involve attempts to detect anything
“unusual”. Typically, anomaly detection problems involve the application of
unsupervised machine learning techniques.</p>
<p>Often, unusual activity (again) involves security-related incidents, including
attacks.  Yet, anomalies can generally describe anything that is out of the
ordinary, and so these may describe other events such as unusual or unexpected
shifts in traffic. Attacks such as those described in the previous section
could be classified as anomalies, of course, and many security problems are
framed as anomaly detection problems, particularly when labeled data is
unavailable. Common applications of anomaly detection in the security domain
include intrusion detection and denial of service attacks, both of which often
involve significant observed deviations from normal behavior. In the case of
intrusion detection, anomaly detection algorithms may identify various
security incidents, including denial of service attacks, compromise by
malware, and so forth.</p>
<p>More generally, anomalies can refer to a broad class of “unusual events”,
which need not reflect security incidents. One common type of anomaly that is
not malicious is an unexpected shift in traffic demand. One notable (and
relatively frequent!) event that causes a massive shift in traffic demand is a
software release. For example, when Apple has released a new version of iOS,
or a new version of World of Warcraft is released, large numbers of Internet
users may attempt to download software updates at the same time. Because these
updates can be quite large, users who download these updates can generate a
massive volume of traffic in a short period of time. Historically, these
events have been referred to as <em>flash crowds</em>. Early work in statistical
anomaly detection for networks has attempted to distinguish flash crowds from
malicious activities such as denial of service attacks. However, regardless of
intent, the anomalies themselves can pose operational challenges for network
operators.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="performance">
<h2>Performance<a class="headerlink" href="#performance" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When network transport and application protocols were simpler, it was possible
to model the behavior of protocols as a function of network conditions (e.g.,
available bandwidth, packet loss rate) in terms of closed-form equations. As
protocols and networked systems become increasingly complicated, however, it
has become more difficult to model the behavior of a network protocol or
application (let alone the user’s experience with the application) in closed
form. The rise of encrypted traffic has also made it difficult to perform
certain types of analysis directly, making it necessary to develop models that
can infer properties of transport protocols or applications indirectly from
various features of the network traffic.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title">Activity: Performance</p>
<p>The <a class="reference internal" href="appendix.html#appendix-network-performance"><span class="std std-ref">Appendix</span></a> provides an opportunity to
explore a network performance application in the context of network traffic
analysis, exploring how application performance is evident in network
traffic.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="quality-of-experience-inference">
<h3>Quality of Experience Inference<a class="headerlink" href="#quality-of-experience-inference" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>An increasingly active area for machine learning inference is <em>application
performance inference</em>, and a related area of <em>quality of experience (QoE)
estimation</em>. As its name suggests application performance inference seeks to
develop models that can infer various properties of application performance
based on directly observable features. For example, within the context of
on-demand video streaming, a machine learning model might be able to infer
characteristics such as <em>video resolution</em> or <em>startup delay</em> (i.e., how long it
takes for the video to start playing) from observable features like packets
per second, bytes per second, and so forth. Beyond inferring application
performance, network operators may also want to predict aspects of user
<em>engagement</em> (including information such as how long a user has been watching
a particular video), from other characteristics of the observed network
traffic (e.g., packet loss, latency).</p>
<p>Quality of experience (QoE) and user engagement estimation can be particularly
challenging given the extent to which network traffic is increasingly
encrypted. The encryption of network traffic payloads can make it more
challenging to infer aspects of QoE because certain information is encrypted.
For example a video stream typically includes client requests for particular
video segments, which can often directly indicate the resolution of that
segment; however, if the request itself is obfuscated through encryption, the
traffic traces themselves will not contain direct indicators of video quality.
As a result, it is often necessary to develop new models and algorithms to
infer the quality of these streams from features in encrypted traffic. These
models typically rely on features such as the rate of arrival of individual
video segments, the size of these segments, and so forth.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="application-service-and-device-identification">
<h3>Application, Service, and Device Identification<a class="headerlink" href="#application-service-and-device-identification" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Machine learning models are sometimes used to identify specific network
elements and applications—a process sometimes referred to as
“fingerprinting”. This process can be used to identify applications, devices,
websites, and other services. <em>Website fingeprinting</em> is a common application
of machine learning whereby a model takes features from network traffic as
input and attempts to identify the website—or even the specific
webpage—that a user is visiting. Because individual websites tend to have a
unique number of objects, and each of those objects tend to have unique sizes,
the combination of the number and size of objects being transferred can often
uniquely identify a website or webpage. Other work has observed that
sets of queries from the Internet’s domain name system (DNS) can also uniquely
identify websites.</p>
<p>Similar sets of features can also be used to identify network endpoints (e.g.,
the type of device that is connecting to the network), the type of service
(e.g., video, web, gaming), and even the specific service (e.g., Netflix,
YouTube), without the benefits of direct traffic inspection. As with QoE
estimation, fingerprinting tasks have become more challenging as a result
of increasing levels of traffic encryption. Yet, the features that are
available as metadata in network traffic, such as packet sizes and
interarrival times, the number of traffic flows, the duration of each flow,
and so forth, have made it possible to uniquely identify applications,
devices, websites, and services even if the underlying traffic itself is
encrypted.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="performance-prediction">
<h3>Performance Prediction<a class="headerlink" href="#performance-prediction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Machine learning can also apply to scenarios where it is necessary to predict
the performance of a networked system, where predicting and evaluating the
performance of the system with closed-form models can often prove inaccurate,
due to complex interdependencies that may exist in these systems. One area,
where machine learning has proved to be useful is “what if”
scenario evaluation, whereby a network operator may want to make a
configuration change (e.g., a planned maintenance event or upgrade) but is
unsure how that change may ultimately affect the performance of the system.
For example, a network operator may want to know how deploying or
re-provisioning a new front-end web proxy might ultimately affect the
response time of the service, which might be a web search engine, a commerce
site, or some other service.</p>
<p>In these cases, the complex interaction between different system components
can make closed-form analysis challenging, and, thus, the ability to model
service response time can make it possible to both analyze and predict a
complex target based on various input features. The challenge in such a case
is ensuring that all relevant features that could affect the target prediction
are captured as input features to the model. Another challenge involves
ensuring that the models are provided enough training data (typically packet
traces, or features derived from these packet traces) to ensure that the
models can make accurate predictions using models that are trained with
sufficiently diverse inputs.</p>
<p>Machine learning models can also be used to perform traffic volume
forecasting, to ensure that networks have sufficient capacity in accordance
with growing traffic demands. These planning models have been used to help
network operators adequately provision capacity, and typically involve
provisioning based on predictions that are fairly far into the future (e.g.,
at least six months). Cellular networks use prediction models to determine
traffic volume at individual cellular towers, as well as across the network;
similarly, fixed-line Internet service providers also use similar models to
predict how traffic demands will grow among a particular group of subscribers
(or households), and thus when it may be necessary to perform additional
provisioning (a so-called “node split”).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="resource-allocation">
<h2>Resource Allocation<a class="headerlink" href="#resource-allocation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Machine learning has also begun to be used in contexts of network resource
allocation and optimization. Resource allocation—the problem of deciding how
much resources should be devoted to a particular traffic flow, application, or
process—can be performed over both
short and long timescales.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Over longer timescales, machine learning can be used to predict and forecast
how demand might change over time, allowing network operators to better
provision network resources.</p></li>
<li><p>Over shorter timescales, machine learning can be used to determine how fast
and application should send, how data should be compressed and encoded, and
even the paths that traffic should take through the network.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In these areas in particular, specific types of machine learning, including
both deep learning and reinforcement learning, are especially applicable.
Below, we discuss some of these applications, and how machine learning is
being applied in these contexts.</p>

<h3>Network Provisioning<a class="headerlink" href="#network-provisioning" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Large service provider networks routinely face questions about when, how, and
where to provision capacity in their networks. Typically, these problems may
entail gathering data about past and present levels of traffic on the network
and making predictions about how traffic patterns will evolve over time. Based
on those predictions, network operators may then make changes to network
configuration that result in additional network capacity, traffic taking
different routes through the network, and so forth.</p>
<p>In this part of the process, where operators make changes to affect
provisioning and topology, machine learning can also play a role, helping
network operators answer “what if” questions about how changes to network
configuration ultimately affect other facets, such as traffic volumes along
different paths, and even application performance. For example, large content
distribution networks such as Google have used machine learning to help
predict how search response time might be affected by the deployment of
additional web caches.</p>

<h3>Coding and Rate Control<a class="headerlink" href="#coding-and-rate-control" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A very active area in networked systems and applications today is the
development of data encoding schemes that measure network conditions and adapt
encoding in real time, to deliver content efficiently.  Network conditions
such as packet loss and latency can vary over time for many reasons, such as
variable traffic loads that may introduce congestion. In such scenarios, when
conditions change, the senders and receivers of traffic may want to adapt how
data is coded, to maximize the likelihood that the data is delivered with low
latency, at the highest possible quality.</p>
<p>Common applications where this problem arises include both on-demand and
real-time video streaming. In both cases, users want to receive a high quality
video. Yet, the network may delay or lose packets, and the receiving client
must then either decode the video with the data it receives or wait for the
lost data to be retransmitted (which may not be an option if retransmission
takes too long). In the past, common encoding schemes would measure network
conditions such as loss rate and compute a level of redundancy to include with
the transmission, in advance. Yet, if that encoding was done ahead of time and
the network conditions change again, then inefficiencies can arise—with
either excess data being sent (if the loss rate is less than planned) or the
client receiving a poor quality stream (if the loss rate is higher than
planned).</p>
<p>Emerging machine-learning based approaches use techniques like reinforcement
learning to determine how to encode a video stream so that the client can
receive a high-quality stream with low latency, even as network conditions
change.  In addition to encoding content according to changing network
conditions, a sender can also adapt its sending rate in response to changing
network conditions (a process known as <em>congestion control</em>). Research has
shown that, in some circumstances, a sender can adjust its sending rate in
ways that optimize a pre-defined objective function in response to changing
network conditions. While the early incarnations have applied game theory to
achieve this optimization, the fundamental questions involve the learnabiity
of congestion control algorithms, and to what extent they can out-perform
manually designed ones.</p>
