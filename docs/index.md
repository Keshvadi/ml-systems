# Machine Learning for Computer Systems

## Course Description

## Structure

Each lecture has a set of slides/notes explaining concepts and an associated
reading. Please do the reading before class. Slides or notes will be posted
after each class.

Whenever possible, lectures will also have an accompanying Jupyter Notebook
with example applications from computer systems to make the concepts more
concrete.
