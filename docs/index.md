# Machine Learning for Computer Systems

## Course Description

## Structure

Each lecture has a set of slides/notes explaining concepts and an associated
reading. Please do the reading before class. Slides or notes will be posted
after each class.

Most lectures will also have an accompanying Jupyter Notebook with example
applications from computer systems to make the concepts more concrete.
