    "# Data Acquisition\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will explore the process of data acquisition. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of *passive* network traffic analysis, there are generally two primary ways of acquiring data:\n",
    "* Packet capture\n",
    "* Network traffic flows (sometimes called IPFIX)\n",
    "\n",
    "The advent of more programmability in networks is quickly changing this landscape. \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, systems like Retina are now making it possible to ask more complex questions of network traffic from passive traffic capture and analysis but the general underlying traffic patterns are still based on raw packet capture.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Because packet captures are so large, it can sometimes be convenient to work with summary statistics about network traffic. Instead of the raw packets, data could represent the total number of bytes, packets, and so forth for flows. \n",
    "\n",
    "Raw traffic capture is thus sometimes represented as summaries of flow statistics, rather than raw packet traces. In this activity, we will *generate* the summary statistics and then think about what types of information is (and is not) available in a packet trace summary vs. a raw packet capture."
