    "# Timeseries Anomaly Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "A significant problem that arises in computer networking is the detection of timeseries anomalies. Specifically, data is captured over time, and network operators may wish to detect when metrics from the data deviate from \"normal\" behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "This activity involves performing timeseries anomaly detection with network performance data captured from a project at University of Chicago, to continually measure network performance metrics, including throughput, latency, DNS lookup times, and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this hands-on, you will combine various anomaly detection approaches with time-series models including:\n",
    "* Moving Average with Seasonal Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "You might also try some of the following methods:\n",
    "* ARIMA \n",
    "* Prophet \n",
    "* changing point detection \n",
    "\n",
    "and apply them to detect anomalous performance in network measurements of latency and bandwidth data from 85 Chicago households. The data for this hands-on activity is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UECNfRXUide5oZpsyLWq2K4g1xkS4_YO/view)."
