    "# Motivation: Network Security\n",
    "\n",
    "By now, you have explored how to peform a simple analysis of a network packet capture. In this hands-on activity, you will explore two network packet captures: (1) A network packet trace containing a network scan. (2) A regular network packet trace with no abnormal or malicious activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not (yet) apply machine learning models to this data. The purpose of this assignment is to give you more experience manipulating network data, but also to think about the types of features in network security incidents that might lend themselves to automated detection of anomalies and attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this hands-on assignment, you should learn the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Gain more experience with network traffic traces.\n",
    "2. Explore the properties of a \"normal\" and \"abnormal\" network traffic trace.\n",
    "3. Think about how these properties differ, and how you might design an automated detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "After these steps, we'll be ready to start thinking about the role of machine learning in solving some of these problems."

    "## Background: Log4j Vulnerability\n",
    "\n",
    "The Log4j vulnerability is a vulnerability to Apache Web servers that resulted in the ability to execute remote code on the victim computer. After a successful attack, an attacker may also be able to steal data from the victim computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the precursors to many remote exploits is a process called *scanning*, whereby an attacker sends traffic to remote destinations on the Internet in an attempt to find vulnerable machines to attack. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because the Log4j vulnerability is a remote web server vulnerability, the attack in fact looks like a sequence of web requests, although the sequence will certainly look different than that of a normal web trace.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the Log4j web trace, I took a short packet trace of web traffic from my home. In this hands-on activity, we'll compare the two and reflect on the differences."
