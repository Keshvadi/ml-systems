    "Data representation plays a critical role in the performance of many machine learning methods in machine learning. The data representation of network traffic often determines the effectiveness of these models as much as the model itself. The wide range of novel events that network operators need to detect (e.g., attacks, malware, new applications, changes in traffic demands) introduces the possibility for a broad range of possible models and data representations.\n",

Here, ùõøùë° might be viewed as a choice of sampling rate for the timeseries, hence the nomenclature.\n",
    "  * SAMP-SIZE: A flow is partitioned into time intervals of equal length ùõøùë°, and the total packet size (i.e., byte count) in each interval is recorded; thus, a flow is represented as a timeseries of byte counts in small time intervals, with one sample per time interval.\n",
