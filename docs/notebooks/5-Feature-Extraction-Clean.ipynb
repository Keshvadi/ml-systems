    "Data representation plays a critical role in the performance of many machine learning methods in machine learning. The data representation of network traffic often determines the effectiveness of these models as much as the model itself. The wide range of novel events that network operators need to detect (e.g., attacks, malware, new applications, changes in traffic demands) introduces the possibility for a broad range of possible models and data representations.\n",
